  <h2>Research Interest</h2>
  <p>
      <!--
    For automation to be used, it must have users.
    Yet planning and control techniques typically ignore the presence of the user, resulting in incomprehensible and uncooperative systems.
-->
    <!--We should add motivation that the real world has people in it so it is imperative for robots to work with people (Inspired by KDC's wesbite) -->
    I examine Human-Robot Interaction through a Control-Theoretic lense.
    Using this lense as an analogy for cognition, my work builds approximate predictors of human behavior.
    These predictions can be incorporated into actionable controllers for better automation.

  <h2>History</h2>

  <p>
  I grew up nestled in the Appalachian hills of Chattanooga, Tennessee.
  My mother taught me from a young age that learning is just playing with concepts and that school can be fun.
  That playfulness seeded enthusiasm and that enthusiasm blossomed into drive as I realized knowledge allows you to transform dreams into reality.
  We organized a robotics team in middle school and I experienced how engineering is a creative act like any other, but with code and gears as my paints and the laws of the universe as my canvas.
  </p>
  <p>
  I raced through the rest of my high school curriculum, finishing high school calculus at 14 and scoring high enough at the ACT to get a college scholarship that paid my tuition in full.
  I enrolled at my hometown university (University of Tennessee at Chattanooga) at the age of 15 and devoured every opportunity to learn and build.
  When the school didn't yet have an electronics club or robotics team, I gathered up comrades and we started one.
  Being at a poorer University taught me academic independence and to beat out my own path.
  Now when I see a lack in my department, I organize and create a solution.
  I'm proud to say I  was invited to bring this gift to University of California, Berkeley and join their excellent community of learners.

  <h2>Undergraduate Research</h2>

  <h3>Fuzzy Logic for Controls Education Project</h3>
  <p>Electrical engineering senior thesis project. Implemented Fuzzy Logic Controller (FLC) on FIRST Robotics Competition (FRC) platform available to local highschools with the goal of disemminating FLC knowledge to highschool students. Although not as mathematically tractable, fuzzy controllers are intuitive to design, making them a potentially useful introuction to feedback controls concepts.
  This work was a proof-of-concept for implementing fuzzy controls with affordable sensors and standard educational hardware for highschools. Although an educational study demonstrating fuzzy controls efficacy as a gateway for controls study has yet to be performed, this work encourages FRC teams that implementing FLCs is feasible.</p>

  <h3>IEEE Region 3 - Student Hardware Competition 2015</h3>
  <p>Locomotion and navigation lead for student robot competition. Assembled and managed team for these two subsystems. Prototyped, tested, designed, assembled, and debugged hardware for locomotion resulting in an autonomous line following robot. Coded control system for locomotion and line following algorithm for navigation of a branching, twisting line with a series of pit stops.</p>

  <h3>Precise Yaw Rotation and Stabilization using Closed Loop Control of Inertial Tail Actuators</h3>
  <p>Built inertial "tail" actuator for millirobot and implemented a feedback controller with feedforward friction linearization in conjunction with Dr. Sarah Bergbreiter's <a href="https://sites.google.com/site/microroboticslaboratory">Maryland Microrobotics Laboratory</a> at University of Maryland.
